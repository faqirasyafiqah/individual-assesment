<center><p style="font-size: 139%;">Talking about experience, I had no work experience after I finish my diploma. However, there is a lot of exciting experience during my diploma at Kolej Poly-tech MARA Alor Setar such as being a volunteer, organizer and also a leader for an event. Obviously, being a leader is not an easy task. Leadership is not just organizing events, making decisions and delegating tasks. Leadership also means service to others and sharing experiences, leadership means ensuring the vibrancy of the student body and the stimulating growth of incoming leaders. This is my first time being a leader for a big event. I was a bit scared but I managed to fight that fear and the event went well. I felr very grateful that I made it successfully after all my hardship.

<p style="font-size: 139%;">My role as a leader logistic bureau for OM Alumnight Dinner which is organized by our class. I was helped by two of my friends. They were very diligent in carrying out their duties and always listening to what I told them. Being an leader in this event, I will never forget and it makes me more braver to handle events like this in the future.

<p style="font-size: 139%;">Last but not least, I also being a volunteer for Kejohanan Sukan Kolej Poly-Tech Mara (SUPTEM). Volunteering gives me an opportunity to change people's lives, including your own. It gives me the satisfaction of playing a role in someone else's life, helping people who may not be able to help themselves. Volunteering is a way of giving back to community while developing important social skills, and gaining valuable work experience all at the same time.</p>
