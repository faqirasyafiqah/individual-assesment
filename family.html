<p style="font-size: 140%;">This is my beloved family. I love them very much. My family is everything for me and valuable to me and is something that should never be taken for granted. I am nothing without my family. Whenever we go in this world and whatever we may achieve, our heart and soul will always be in our home because it is where our beautiful family is. Nothing in this world can be stronger than the <strong>bonding of the blood</strong>. I cannot imagine living my life without my family by my side. <br></p>

<br>

 <p style="font-size: 140%;">As saying goes, <q><b><i>Family is the best thing you could ever wish for. They are there for you during the ups and downs and love you no matter what.</i></b></p></q>

<br>

<p style="font-size: 140%;">My family is small with seven members which is my mother, my father, my elder sister, three younger brother and me. All my family members love, respect and care for each other. My family always goes for a picnic once every two weeks. Through that activities our family can strengthen family relationships.</p>

He is very a hardworking person but he never neglected our family and he loves our family very much. My mother is a teacher. She works at Sekolah Kebangsaan Pantai Senak, Bachok. She is kind and caring person. When she finished teaching she cooks for our family. She is the strongest women that I ever known. <b>THANK YOU FOR GIVING BIRTH TO ME, MOM!</b></p>

<p style="font-size: 140%;">This is my sibliings and my mother. This picture was taking by my father when we are having holiday in Jerai Hill, Kedah. Siblings relationship is one of the long lasting relationships in most people's lives. No matter how much you hate but everyone loves their brother and sister in one way or another. Maybe my three younger brother is the most annoying in the whole world sometimes but he still my brother. My sister has the same interest as me. We always talk about the things that we loved at night before sleep. Although she always gets angry at me when I am wrong but she is a good person. I am very grateful for having a wonderful family in my life. My family has taught me good lessons about love, unity and cooperation among ourselves. I always pray to God to protect my family from all evils and vices and keep us safe from all dangers of life.</p></div>
